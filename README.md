- âš¡ Fun fact - Did you know that the concept of a "doodle" has been reimagined and transformed into a form of art and expression known as "zentangle"? Zentangle is a meditative art form that involves creating intricate patterns within a confined space, often with repetitive and structured strokes. It started as a way to relax and focus the mind, and now many people use it as a creative outlet. It's a fascinating blend of mindfulness and artistic expression.
