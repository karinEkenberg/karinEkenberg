## 📚 Outside of Tech
When I’m not studying or coding, I enjoy drawing, language learning (especially German 🇩🇪), and nature walks.  
I have a new found passion in being in the forest, picking berries and a lot of mushrooms 🍄. I also love setting 
daily step goals, it’s my favorite way to recharge and stay focused!
